Swin Transformer, introduced by Liu et al. (2021), leverages shifted window-based self-attention for superior performance (~87-89% ImageNet Top-1, 97-99% with fine-tuning on small datasets), surpassing CNNs like AlexNet and EfficientNetV2-L. With ~197M parameters, Swin-L is a high-end Vision Transformer (ViT) variant optimized for accuracy, retaining the 7-step structure and adapting to its transformer architecture.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "#### Minimum of the Loss Function\n",
        "\n",
        "- Goal of Training: The primary goal of training a machine learning model is to find the set of parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the loss function. This ensures that the model's predictions are as close as possible to the actual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Global Minimum: The global minimum is the point where the loss function has the lowest possible value. Achieving this means that the model has the best possible set of parameters for making accurate predictions on the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Local Minimum: The loss function might have several local minima, which are points where the function value is lower than the surrounding points but not necessarily the lowest possible value overall. These can sometimes trap optimization algorithms, preventing them from finding the global minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Visualization\n",

        "- Convex Functions: For simple models, the loss function might be convex, resembling a bowl shape where the bottom represents the global minimum.\n",
        "- Non-Convex Functions: For complex models like deep neural networks, the loss function is often non-convex, resembling a landscape with multiple peaks and valleys.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Optimization\n",
        "- Gradient Descent: One common method to find the minimum of the loss function is gradient descent. This iterative optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient) of the loss function.\n",
        "- Learning Rate: The learning rate determines the step size taken during each iteration of gradient descent. A well-chosen learning rate helps in efficiently converging to the minimum.\n",
        "Importance\n",
        "- Model Performance: Finding the minimum of the loss function is crucial for model performance. It directly impacts how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
        "- Overfitting and Underfitting: Balancing the minimization process is important to avoid overfitting (model too closely fits the training data) and underfitting (model doesn't capture the underlying patterns in the data).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example\n",
        "- Consider a simple linear regression problem where we want to fit a line to a set of data points. The loss function could be the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values and the actual values. The training process involves adjusting the slope and intercept of the line to minimize the MSE, finding the best fit line that represents the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In summary, the minimum of the loss function represents the point where the model's predictions are most accurate with respect to the training data, and finding this minimum is the primary objective of the training process in machine learning."
